                <p class="pratext">I can transform objects in reality into something else. My favorite was when I transformed
                    Chihiro's parents into pigs after they greedily ate food that was meant for spirits. 
                    I can also undo the transformation at wil.
                    I am notorious for turning humans that cross my path into animals for fun.
                    Besides transforming things into something else, I can also transform myself into a bird.

                    I also have the ability to move objects with my mind using the power channeled through my hands.
                    My favorite time was when I dragged Chihiro into my office without physically touching her. 
                    I pulled her into my room with my mind and also locked and shut the doors. 
                    Another time was when I made the paper for Chihiro's contract levitate, so she could sign it.

                    My third ability is the pwoer to give a person a certain social status or to change an event through 
                    some sort of an agreement. I use this power to control all my employees at the bathhouse so they 
                    can't defy or rebel against me. Some examples of when I used this power include manipulated Haku
                    so that he would be loyal to me and work for me forever.
